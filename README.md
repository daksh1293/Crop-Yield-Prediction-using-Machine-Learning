# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning  

Crop yield prediction is one of the challenging problems in precision agriculture, and many models have been proposed and validated so far. This problem requires the use of several datasets since crop yield depends on many different factors such as climate, weather, soil, use of fertilizer, pH and seed variety.This indicates that crop yield prediction is not a trivial task; instead, it consists of several complicated steps. Nowadays, crop yield prediction models can estimate the actual yield reasonably, but a better performance in yield prediction is still desirable. So, the models need to be trained using datasets, where the outcomes are represented based on past experience. The predictive model is built using several features, and as such, parameters of the models are determined using historical data during the training phase. For the testing phase, part of the historical data that has not been used for training is used for the performance evaluation purpose.You need to create a ML Model that takes all the above factors in consideration and give predictions/prescriptions that would help farmers to increase their crop productivity, and hence gain more profit by being more productive.
